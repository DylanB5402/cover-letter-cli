<p> To Appfolio:</p>

<p>
    I&rsquo;m a junior at UC San Diego interested in applying for the position of Software Engineer Intern. Once I decided to become a computer science major, I decided I wanted to get work experience in the software industry as early as I could. The summer after my freshman year of college, I worked as a Software Developer intern at the San Diego Supercomputer Center for 10 weeks. I worked alongside a team of 6 other interns to develop a minimalistic social media web application. I was a backend developer, writing the server-side code for the app using Javascript and the Express framework. I also handled integrating frontend and backend pages, writing the logic for our login and friend systems and making sure the server served the correct pages. I collaborated with my fellow interns using Git and Gitlab, making 141 commits and authoring 12 merge requests over the course of the internship.

    This previous summer (Summer 2022), I interned at AppFolio, a software company specializing in creating software for the property management industry. I worked on the documents team which was responsible for the AppFolio document submission system which allows property managers to send their tenants leases and other documents to sign electronically, similar to Docusign, but fully integrated into the AppFolio system. I was paired with an experienced software engineer as a mentor, and I learned a lot about writing software at the industry-scale and about working within an established, mature codebase. I worked on the same production stories alongside the full-time developers and was treated as a full, if junior, member of the team. I worked on both backend and frontend features, working with Ruby on Rails and React within multiple codebases that integrated and communicated with each other.

<p>
    I&rsquo;m now looking for a Summer 2023 internship. I&rsquo;m interested in continuing to work within the software industry and gaining experience at different companies. I've worked in both frontend and backend development roles and am comfortable working with both. I want to see what interests me about working in different areas and with different technologies.
